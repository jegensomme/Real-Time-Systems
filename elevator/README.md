# Elevator

It is required to implement a model of the operation of the machine that controls the elevator when it is called

from a certain floor.

A staircase of some floor of the house is being considered. There is a panel with two buttons near the elevator door

Calls "Up" and "Down" (Down). It is assumed that the elevator can be in one of three static

states (state) - top (TOP), on the given floor (THIS_FLOOR) and below (BOTTOM).

When you press the "Up" or "Down" button, a command is formed (a real-time signal Up or Down is sent),

and the elevator moves according to the table below. It is assumed that after

when the elevator arrives at the call floor, a delay of 1s is maintained, and the elevator moves up or down depending on

from which call button was pressed
